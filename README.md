The hotel keeps records of reservations and payments for booked services. The primary customer (contract holder) can reserve one or more rooms of the desired type and specify the names of other guests included in the arrangement.
To accommodate flexible payments, the contract holder should be given the option to pay in installments. 
While the number of installments is not limited, the full payment of the arrangement must be completed by the contractually agreed date. 
Any payment method for individual installments—cash, card, etc.—is acceptable.
